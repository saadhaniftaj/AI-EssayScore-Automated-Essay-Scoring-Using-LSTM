# Automated Essay Scoring (AES) System

This project implements an **Automated Essay Scoring (AES) system** using machine learning techniques, specifically LSTM layers. The goal is to develop a model that can evaluate essays based on predefined criteria and produce a score that approximates human scoring. This project serves as a foundation for assessing textual content, a useful application in educational technology and online learning platforms.

## Project Overview

Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is a fast-growing area in natural language processing and machine learning, aiming to assist educators by providing a scalable, objective, and rapid assessment solution for written content. This project applies a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, an effective model for handling sequential data like text, to predict essay scores.

### Key Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization of essays for effective modeling.
- **LSTM Model Architecture**: Designed to handle sequential data with recurrent layers to capture the contextual meaning.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The model performance is evaluated based on mean squared error (MSE) to quantify the difference between predicted and actual scores.
